## COVID-19 "Angela"
[[Live Version]](https://boring-wozniak-c62dd8.netlify.app/#/)

A Full-stack app that involves collecting shopping, medication or other essential supplies for someone who is self-isolating/vulnerable, and delivering the supplies to their home.



During this project I got to consolidate and expand on everything I had learnt in the previous 6 weeks @ CodeClan.

* Javascript, Vue.js, MongoDB, HTML & CSS
* Leaflet
* DOM manipulation
* Agile methodologies

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Project Overview:

* The app should allow the user to create and edit categories for their requests, e.g. groceries, medication.
* The app should allow the user to create and edit requests, e.g. Milk, Oats, Bananas.
* The app should allow the user to delete and edit categories and requests.
* The user should be able to assign self-isolating/vulnerable to volunteers, as well as pin the request on the leaflet map.
