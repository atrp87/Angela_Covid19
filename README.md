## COVID-19 "Angela"

Worked in a team of three where we used Aagile methodologies (SCRUM), grouped with paired and mob programming.

We had one week to create a Web application that involves collecting shopping, medication or other essential supplies for someone who is self-isolating/vulnerable, and delivering these supplies to their home.

During this project we got to consolidate and expand on everything I had learned in the previous 6 weeks @ CodeClan.

* OOP (Javascript)
• Web app development (Vue.js)
• TDD in (JavaScript | Mocha)
• DB design (MongoDB)
• HTML and CSS
• DOM manipulation
• Git and GitHub
• Agile methodologies

### Project Overview:

* The app should allow the user to create and edit categorys for their requests, e.g. groceries, medication.
* The app should allow the user to create and edit requests, e.g. Milk, Oats, Bananas.
* The app should allow the user to delete and edit categorys and requests.
* The user should be able to assign self-isolating/vulnerable to a volunteers, as well as pin the request on the leaflet map.
