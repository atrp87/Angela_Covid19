## General Information
- Group project, we had a team of 3 and used the scrum framework for the week where we presented our project on the final day. Fully remote where the team utilised VS Codeâ€™s live share extension allowing collaborative work on bigger features or supporting one another when tackling problems.
- Local JSON API to add and manage requests
- Geolocation API to get the geographical position of a user
- Nominatim API to acquire the geographic coordinates
- Leaflet maps markers to pin requests on the map


## Technologies Used
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - version 2.6.11
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - version 1.6.0
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - version 3.5.9
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - version 4.4.1


## Lessons Learned
- Git Branching and Merging - Getting more exposure creating an isolated environment to try out a new feature and merging it to the develop branch and resolving conflicts that surfaced.

- Using the Scrum framework one of our instructors acted as a product owner but we created the backlog ourselves and picked off user stories to plan each sprint. One of us acted as a Scrum master to manage the work we were doing.

- External APIs and async Javascript ( Promises, fetch API and error handling ).
