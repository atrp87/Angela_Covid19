Group project, we had a team of 3 and used the scrum framework for the week where we presented our project on the final day. Fully remote where the team utilised VS Codeâ€™s live share extension allowing collaborative work on bigger features or supporting one another when tackling problems.

### Lessons Learned:

Git Branching and Merging - Getting more exposure creating an isolated environment to try out a new feature and merging it to the develop branch and resolving conflicts that surfaced.

Using the Scrum framework one of our instructors acted as a product owner but we created the backlog ourselves and picked off user stories to plan each sprint. One of us acted as a Scrum master to manage the work we were doing.

External APIs and async Javascript ( Promises, fetch API and error handling ).
