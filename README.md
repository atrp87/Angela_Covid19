## COVID-19 "Angela"

Worked in a team of three where we had one week to colaborate on a 

During this project I got to consolidate and expand on everything I had learned in the previous 3 weeks @ CodeClan.

Ruby | PostgreSQL | Sinatra
HTML | CSS
Restful routes
CRUD Actions
Single responsibility
project structure and good naming conventions.
Breif:
The app should allow the user to create and edit merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
The app should allow the user to create and edit tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport
The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.
Project Overview:
Planning
Object oriented programming with Ruby
Web Programming (Sinatra, REST, MVC)
Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)
Version control Git & GitHub
